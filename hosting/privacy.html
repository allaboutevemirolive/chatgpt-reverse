    <h1>Privacy Policy for ChatGPT Reverse</h1>

    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 2024-04-06</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the "ChatGPT Reverse" Chrome
        Extension ("the Extension", "we", "us", or "our") handles your
        information when you use the extension. This Extension is designed
        to enhance your experience on chatgpt.com by interacting with its
        underlying API.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> This extension operates entirely within
        your browser. We do not operate any external servers, and we do not
        collect or transmit your personal data or conversation content to
        our own servers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Handle</h2>
    <p>
        To function, the Extension needs to access certain information
        available within your browser session on chatgpt.com. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>API Headers/Tokens:</strong> The Extension intercepts
            and stores necessary authentication tokens and headers (like
            <code>Authorization</code>, <code>OAI-Device-Id</code>,
            <code>OAI-Language</code>) generated during your session with
            chatgpt.com.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Session-Related Data (Potentially):</strong> If specific
            features require it, the Extension may attempt to read certain
            cookies from the chatgpt.com domain using the
            <code>chrome.cookies</code> API (e.g., cookies related to your
            session or user settings on ChatGPT).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Conversation Data (Locally Processed):</strong> For
            features like Markdown export, audio generation, or token
            counting, the Extension accesses conversation data (IDs,
            content, metadata) via the chatgpt.com API using your stored
            headers/tokens. This processing happens locally within the
            Extension's service worker.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information handled by the Extension is used solely for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Enabling Functionality:</strong> Stored API
            headers/tokens are used exclusively to make authenticated
            requests to the official chatgpt.com API endpoints from within
            the Extension (e.g., fetching conversations, deleting chats,
            generating audio, exporting).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Local Processing:</strong> Conversation data accessed
            via the API is processed locally within your browser to provide
            features like formatting exports or counting tokens. It is not
            sent elsewhere by the Extension.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Session Management (Potentially):</strong> Information
            read from cookies (if implemented and necessary) would be used
            to ensure the Extension interacts correctly with your
            chatgpt.com session.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Local Storage:</strong> API headers/tokens and any other
            necessary session data intercepted or configured are stored
            using the <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API. This data
            remains on your computer within the browser's secure extension
            storage.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Security:</strong> While we store this data locally for
            functionality, please be aware that browser storage security
            depends on the overall security of your computer and Google
            account. The stored tokens grant access to your ChatGPT
            account, similar to being logged into the website.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No External Transmission:</strong> We reiterate that the
            Extension does not send your API tokens, conversation content,
            or any personal data to any external servers operated by us or
            third parties. All API communication happens directly between
            your browser (via the Extension) and the official chatgpt.com
            servers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share any of the information handled by the Extension with
        any third parties. The data stays within your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension requests permission to access cookies specifically for
        the <code>chatgpt.com</code> domain. This permission may be used in
        the future to read necessary session or configuration cookies from
        ChatGPT to ensure proper functioning or enable specific features.
        The Extension does not set its own cookies and only reads cookies
        set by <code>chatgpt.com</code> when necessary for its operation.
    </p>

    <h2>7. User Control</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You can clear the data stored by the Extension (including API
            tokens) by clearing your browser's extension data or by
            uninstalling the Extension.
        </li>
        <li>
            Uninstalling the Extension will remove all stored data and stop
            all its functionality.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
        you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page
        and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review
        this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>

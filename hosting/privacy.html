    <h1>Privacy Policy for ChatGPT Reverse</h1>

    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 2025-05-02</p> <!-- Update Date -->

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the "ChatGPT Reverse" Chrome
        Extension ("the Extension", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses,
        and handles your information when you use the extension. This
        Extension is designed to enhance your experience on
        <code>chatgpt.com</code> by interacting with its underlying API and
        offering optional premium features requiring user accounts and
        payments.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect or Handle</h2>
    <p>
        To provide its core and premium features, the Extension handles or
        collects the following types of information:
    </p>

    <h3>2.1 Information Handled for Core ChatGPT Interaction:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>ChatGPT API Headers/Tokens:</strong> The Extension
            intercepts and stores necessary authentication tokens and headers
            (like <code>Authorization</code>, <code>OAI-Device-Id</code>)
            generated during your session with <code>chatgpt.com</code>.
            This happens locally within your browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>ChatGPT Conversation Data (Locally Processed):</strong>
            For features like Markdown export, audio generation, or token
            counting, the Extension accesses conversation data (IDs,
            content, metadata) via the <code>chatgpt.com</code> API using
            your stored headers/tokens. This processing happens locally
            within the Extension's service worker.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>ChatGPT Website Content:</strong> The Extension reads the
            text content of your conversations on <code>chatgpt.com</code>
            to enable its features.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Network Activity (on chatgpt.com):</strong> The Extension
            monitors network requests made to <code>chatgpt.com</code> to
            intercept necessary API tokens and headers. This monitoring is
            limited to the <code>chatgpt.com</code> domain.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>ChatGPT Cookies (Potentially):</strong> The Extension
            requests permission to read cookies specifically from the
            <code>chatgpt.com</code> domain. This may be used to ensure
            proper interaction with your ChatGPT session if required by future
            updates or specific features. The Extension does not set its own
            cookies on this domain.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Information Collected for Optional Accounts & Subscriptions:</h3>
    <p>
        To access premium ("Pro") features, you may choose to create an
        account and purchase a subscription. This involves collecting:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Email Address:</strong> Collected during account
                    registration or login for account identification and
                    communication.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>User ID (UID):</strong> A unique identifier assigned
                    by Firebase Authentication upon account creation, used to
                    link your account to your subscription data.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Authentication Information:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Password:</strong> Collected securely during
                    registration and login via Firebase Authentication for
                    account security. We do not store your plaintext password.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Financial and Payment Information:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Transaction Facilitation:</strong> When you choose
                    to purchase a subscription, you are redirected to Stripe,
                    our third-party payment processor. Stripe collects your
                    payment information (like credit card numbers) directly; we
                    <strong>do not</strong> collect or store this sensitive
                    payment information ourselves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subscription Status & History:</strong> We store
                    information about your subscription plan (e.g., "monthly",
                    "lifetime"), its status (e.g., "active", "canceled"), and
                    associated identifiers (linked to your User ID) provided by
                    Stripe via the Firebase Stripe Payments Extension. This is
                    stored in our Firestore database to manage your access to
                    Pro features.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Location (IP Address):</strong> Like most online services,
            when you interact with our authentication (Firebase) or payment
            processing (Stripe via Firebase Functions), your IP address is
            transmitted as part of standard internet communication protocols.
            We do not specifically store or use your IP address for tracking
            location beyond what is necessary for these services to function
            (e.g., for security, regional compliance).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Information Handled Through Extension UI Interaction:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>User Activity (Clicks):</strong> We register clicks within the
            extension's popup and sidebar UI to trigger extension features
            (e.g., clicking "Export", "Login", "Manage Subscription").
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Core ChatGPT Interaction:</strong> Stored ChatGPT API
            headers/tokens are used exclusively to make authenticated requests
            to the official <code>chatgpt.com</code> API endpoints from
            within the Extension (e.g., fetching conversations, deleting
            chats, generating audio, exporting). Conversation content is
            processed locally for features like export or audio generation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Account Management:</strong> Your email, password (hashed),
            and Firebase UID are used by Firebase Authentication to create and
            secure your optional account for accessing Pro features.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Subscription Management:</strong> Your Firebase UID and
            subscription status information (received from Stripe and stored
            in Firestore) are used to grant access to Pro features and allow
            you to manage your subscription via the Stripe Customer Portal.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Payment Processing:</strong> We initiate redirects to
            Stripe for payment processing. We use the subscription status
            provided by Stripe to manage your access.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Functionality and Improvement:</strong> We use click data
            within the extension UI to understand feature usage and improve
            the user experience. IP addresses are used implicitly by underlying
            services (Firebase, Stripe) for security and operation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Communication:</strong> We may use your provided email address
            to communicate important information regarding your account or
            subscription (if you create an account).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Local Storage (Browser):</strong> ChatGPT API
            headers/tokens are stored using
            <code>chrome.storage.local</code> on your computer.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Your email and hashed
            password are stored securely within Google's Firebase
            Authentication service when you create an account.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firestore Database:</strong> Your Firebase User ID and
            associated subscription details (plan type, status, Stripe IDs)
            are stored in Google's Firestore database, secured using
            standard Firebase security rules.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stripe:</strong> Payment details (credit card numbers,
            etc.) are handled and stored directly by Stripe, our payment
            processor, which adheres to stringent security standards (PCI
            DSS). We do not store this information.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No External Transmission (Core Functionality):</strong>
            The Extension does not send your ChatGPT API tokens, ChatGPT
            conversation content, or any personal data related to your ChatGPT
            usage to any external servers operated by us. All core API
            communication happens directly between your browser (via the
            Extension) and the official <code>chatgpt.com</code> servers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Security Note:</strong> The security of locally stored data
            (like ChatGPT tokens) and your Firebase/Stripe accounts depends on
            the overall security of your computer and your account credentials.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>No Sharing of ChatGPT Data:</strong> We do not share your
            ChatGPT API tokens or conversation content with any third parties.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase & Stripe:</strong> Information required for
            authentication (email, hashed password) is processed by Firebase.
            Information required for payment and subscription management
            (including linking your Firebase UID to Stripe customer/subscription
            IDs) is processed by Stripe and Firestore via the Firebase Stripe
            Payments Extension. These are essential service providers for the
            optional account/subscription features. Please refer to the
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase (Google)
                Privacy Policy</a>
            and the <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stripe Privacy
                Policy</a>
            for details on how they handle data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Other Third Parties:</strong> We do not share your personal
            information or usage data with any other third parties, except as
            required by law.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>6. User Control and Rights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Local Data:</strong> You can clear locally stored ChatGPT
            API tokens by clearing your browser's extension data for this
            Extension or by uninstalling it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Account Data:</strong> If you create an account, you can
            typically manage your email and password through standard
            Firebase Authentication methods (which may be exposed via account
            management features in the future). You can request account
            deletion by contacting us (see Section 9).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Subscription Management:</strong> If you have a paid
            subscription, you can manage it (e.g., cancel, update payment
            method) via the Stripe Customer Portal, accessible through the
            "Manage Subscription" button in the Extension's account interface.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Uninstalling:</strong> Uninstalling the Extension will
            remove locally stored data and stop all its functionality. It does
            not automatically delete your Firebase account or cancel your
            Stripe subscription (if applicable); these must be managed
            separately if desired.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13
        (or the relevant age of digital consent in your region). We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
        you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
        this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to
        review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
